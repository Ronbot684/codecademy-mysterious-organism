It took me a very short amount of time, maybe a few hours and honestly getting the mutate method and the printing function to work took the most time, but I'm still proud of what I've done.
As much as I would've liked to get it out earlier, this was during a busy period, so while it took a few hours, it's been a few days since the last project.
In addition though, I added comments to get myself more used to adding them for the future.
